This repository documents the steps to creates Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), which consists of the following:
- A feature, being a JavaScript script which logs a message: "Hello" (MVP#1)
- A new feature, being an improvement of the JavaScript script which logs a message: "Hello World" (MVP#2)
- A hotfix of the JavaScript script which logs a message: "Hello World!" (MVP#3)

We start from scratch.
